6|You stumble around like a hapless infant, leaving a trail behind you.
1|Why hello to you too.
6|I’m not sure if you're callous or clueless.
6|Or perhaps a little of both. Like an infant, really.
4|Is that how you guys greet your guests? With a long string of insults?
6|You're not a guest. You're a trespasser. And thus need not be afforded pleasantries.
5|I'm here to help.
6|You don’t seem to be helping much.
1|What. You enjoy this awful ice and cold and constant food deprivation?
6|……
6|Things aren't always as they seem.
4|Oh come on!
6|I beg your pardon.
1|We are not doing the cryptic antagonist crap.
6|I haven't-
1|You even have the right hair.
6|The right-
1|It's slick. And flowing. Very video game antagonist.
6|If you're being purposefully confusing to distract me, it's not working.
1|It worked.
6|If words cannot convince you to leave, perhaps actions will.
3|Ack- Give a guy some warning before you start hacking at him, will you?
