0|Agent, status report.
1|Hm.
0|Status report.
1|Freezing.
0|What's the temperature like in Interrium?
1|Like a severe case of hypothermia.
0|Can I get a straight answer?
1|You could pull the data straight from my implants.
0|That would be an unnecessary invasion of privacy.
1|Yes.
4|……
4|Feel free to read off the machines you've put in me.
0|Your compliance is greatly appreciated.
0|[Downloading Data]
0|[Data Acquired]
0|Hmm…
0|It appears that the Interrium sector shows signs of supporting lifeform.
4|Lifeform.
0|Yes.
4|Was that a joke?
0|As such, you need to make defrosting the terrain your foremost priority.
4|And staying alive is only secondary, of course.
0|Do note that unexpected termination would be terribly inconvenient. Sending a new agent to Interrium would be far too costly in so short a period of time.
4|I wouldn't want my death to be an inconvenience.
0|If your continued existence becomes a concern, our data tells me that there is an oddly isolated node channeling a vast amount of thermal energy up ahead. You should be able to use it for sustenance.
1|This thing isn't going to last me.
0|Probability dictates that more of such nodes may be uncovered as you explore the area.
1|I don't suppose you have a map I can download?
0|You're in uncharted ice, Agent.
1|I'd appreciate that pun a lot more if I wasn't going to die.
0|Before we cut our connection, I've been told to inform you that according to past reports, weather conditions become dangerously unpredictable come nightfall.
0|So we'll transport you back to your ship through molecular relocation before dusk. I'm afraid even your altered physique wouldn't be able to survive the elements there.
0|Good luck, Agent.
1|Yeah, thanks.
0|[Call disconnected.]
1|For nothing.
