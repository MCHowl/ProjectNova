0|Agent, status report.
1|Hm.
0|Status report.
1|Cold, tired and hungry.
0|......
1|......
0|I didn't mean your status, I meant- Oh, never mind. It's cold?
1|Freezing.
0|What's the temperature like in Sector 328?
1|Like a severe case of hypothermia.
0|Am I ever going to get a straight answer?
1|You could pull the data straight from my implants.
0|That would be an unnecessary invasion of privacy.
1|Yes.
1|Do you require verbal consent to proceed.
0|Well, you're not obliged-
4|Feel free to read off the machines you've put in me.
0|Your compliance is greatly appreciated.

0|[Data Acquired]
0|Hmm…
1|That sounds foreboding.
0|I just hmm-ed!
1|It was a foreboding 'hmm'.
0|What- Never mind. It appears that Sector 328, hereafter codenamed Interrium, shows signs of supporting lifeform.
4|Lifeform.
0|Yes.
4|Was that a joke?
0|As such, you need to make defrosting the terrain your foremost priority.
4|And staying alive is only secondary, of course.
0|Do note that unexpected termination would be terribly inconvenient. Sending a new agent to Interrium would be far too costly in so short a period of time.
4|I wouldn't want my death to be an inconvenience.
0|If your continued existence becomes a concern, our data tells me that there is an oddly isolated node channeling a vast amount of thermal energy up ahead. You should be able to use it for sustenance.
1|This thing isn't going to last me.
0|Probability dictates that more of such nodes may be uncovered as you explore the area.
1|I don't suppose you have a map I can download?
0|You're in uncharted ice, Agent.
1|I'd appreciate that pun a lot more if I wasn't going to die.
0|Before we cut our connection, I've been told to inform you that according to past reports, weather conditions become dangerously unpredictable come nightfall.
0|So we'll transport you back to your ship through molecular relocation before dusk. I'm afraid even your altered physique wouldn't be able to survive the elements there.
0|Good luck, Agent.
1|Yeah, thanks.
0|[Call disconnected.]
1|For nothing.
