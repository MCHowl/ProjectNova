1|So I've got a serious question for you.
6|You knew I was here.
1|You're a little predictable.
1|Anyway. How do you do the disappearing and reappearing thing?
6|……
6|That’s on a need to know basis.
1|But I’m dying with curiosity.
6|If I told you, would you leave?
1|It's not like that’s going to do you any good. You chase me away, and they'll just send someone else.
6|I'd chase them away too.
1|You can’t chase everyone away. We've got a huge military. I mean special ops is a little more specialised-
1|Special ops.
1|Trained in combat, espionage and warfare. Such as yours truly.
6|So you weren't a clueless, bumbling infant.
1|Look, I'm just following orders.
1|Maybe if we sit down and discuss things, like adults! We could figure something...
1|Hey, what's gotten into you.
3|Oi!
